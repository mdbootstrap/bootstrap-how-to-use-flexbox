# How to use flexbox in Bootstrap? 

In Bootstrap we used flexbox by applying utilitiy classes to HTML elements. Bootstrap provides a wide range of flexbox utilities for managing the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, and more.

## Enable flex behaviors

Apply `display` utilities to create a flexbox container and transform **direct children elements** into flex items. Flex containers and items are able to be modified further with additional flex properties.

```html
<div class="d-flex p-2">I'm a flexbox container!</div>
```

```html
<div class="d-inline-flex p-2">I'm an inline flexbox container!</div>
```
